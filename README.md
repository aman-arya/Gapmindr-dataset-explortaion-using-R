# Gapmindr-dataset-explortaion-using-R

# Goal: Using R explore the following dataset

**children_per_woman_total_fertility** : It includes the data of average children per woman for 194 different countries  per year from the year 1800 to 2100.

**child_mortality_0_5_year_olds_dying_per_1000_born** : It includes the data of child mortality(children under 5 year's age dying per 1000) for 183 different countries  per year from the year 1800 to 2100.

**income_per_person_gdppercapita_ppp_inflation_adjusted** : It includes the data of GDP per capita for 192 different countries  per year from the year 1800 to 2100.

**life_expectancy_years** : It includes the data of Life expectancy for 186 different countries  per year from the year 1800 to 2100.

**population_total** : It includes the data of Total Population for 194 different countries  per year from the year 1800 to 2100.

# Hypothesis
we want to compare **INDIA** with mean for top 10 developed countries , 10 developing counties and 10 under developed counties

we explore each dataset individually. We consider ten countries each for three different sets of Countries (Developed, Developing and Under Developed), for each set of countries we take the mean of sample values for each year.We have counsidered mean of 10 countries because it will help us make a more accurate estimate of what trend a country from a set is likely to follow. Later we plot these means for Developed, Developing and Under Developed countries and compare their trends. We also make certain Hypothesis regarding the data we observe and try to prove or reject those Hypothesis with help of various Hypothesis testing methods learnt in this course so far. Countries that are considered are :

**Developed Countries** : Norway , Ireland , Switzerland , Hong Kong , Iceland , Germany , Sweden , Australia, Netherlands , Denmark

**Developing Countries** : Algeria , Lebanon , Fiji , Moldova , Maldives , Tunisia , Saint Vincent and the  Grenadines , Suriname , Mongolia , Botswana

**Underdeveloped Countries** : Eritrea , Mozambique , Burkina Faso , Sierra Leone , Mali , Burundi , South Sudan , Chad , Central African Republic , Niger


     Note: All the list of countries has been taken from **HDR website** http://www.hdr.undp.org/
